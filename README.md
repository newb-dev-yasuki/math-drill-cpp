# math-drill-cpp

This is a terminal-based application project I made long ago in 2023, and improved it in 2025 (using OOP), that test a user's skill in solving mathematical equations.
The game has 4 difficulties you can choose from based on your skill level you're comfortable with and with each a number of questions you want to solve.

You can also customise the responses in the program to your liking using the file provided in the `data/` directory, so go ahead - go ham!

This game was primarily made in Windows, for Windows, so feel free to change the source code (from forking it) to compile it for compatibility with your device.

Enjoy!
