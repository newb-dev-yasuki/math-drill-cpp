# math-drill-cpp

This is a terminal-based application project I made long ago in 2023, and improved it in 2025 (using OOP), that test a user's skill in solving mathematical equations.
The game has 4 difficulties you can choose from based on your skill level you're comfortable with and with each a number of questions you want to solve.

This game was primarily made in Windows, for Windows, so feel free to change the source code (from forking it) to compile it for compatibility with your device.

Enjoy!
